According to the XML Schema spec,
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#regexs,
"Unlike some popular regular expression languages (including those
defined by Perl and standard Unix utilities), the regular expression
language defined here implicitly anchors all regular expressions at the
head and tail, as the most common use of regular expressions in
·pattern· is to match entire literals."

Given this datatype, binding, and input:

<xsd:simpleType name="zipCode">
   <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string">
      <xsd:pattern value="\d{5}"/>
   </xsd:restriction>
</xsd:simpleType>

<xforms:bind id="zip" required="true()"
   type="ftype:zipCode" nodeset="/data/zip" />

<xforms:input bind="street">
  <xforms:label>Zip Code: </xforms:label>
</xforms:input>

If I enter "abc90210def" into the field (without the quotemarks), the
form is accepted as valid, but it shouldn't be.  I can add ^ and $ to
the pattern to make it work, but that's not in the spec.
