		<cm:wiki>'''XSLTForms Javascript''' parts are activated just '''after the XSLT transformation''' performed by the browser.
The "init()" function is created by the XSLT transformation according to the XForms document, with "xforms.init()" as the last function call, and called by the "onload" event associated with the "body" element.
Many Javascript objects and functions can be called directly by developers for specific purposes considering that misuse can '''compromise''' the XSLTForms global behavior.</cm:wiki>
